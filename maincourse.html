       <div class="r4"><p>directions<br>
Fill a large pot with 14 cups water, chicken pieces, backbone, wings, parsley, thyme, bay leaf, salt, and peppercorns.<br>
 Bring to a boil. Skim foam, reduce heat, and gently simmer for 25 minutes. <br>
Remove chicken (except wings); continue simmering while you discard skin and remove meat from bones.<br>
 Cover meat and refrigerate; return bones to pot and simmer 3 1/2 hours more.<br>
Strain broth through a fine-mesh sieve and discard solids, including bones and wings.<br>
 Skim fat and transfer broth to a clean pot. Add onions, carrots, fennel, and tomatoes.<br>
 Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until vegetables are very tender, 25 minutes.<br>
Cut or tear reserved chicken into 3 cups of bite-size pieces. (You'll end up with an extra cup of meat; save it for a salad or a sandwich.)<br>
 Add to broth, along with ditalini, basil, and lemon juice. Heat through, about 2 minutes. <br>
Season with salt and pepper, top with red-pepper flakes and Parmesan, and serve.</p></div>
