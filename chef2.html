<div class="pic1"><p>Delia Smith CBE (born 18 June 1941) is an English cook and television presenter, known for teaching basic cookery skills in a no-nonsense style.<br>
 She is the UK's best-selling cookery author, with more than 21 million copies sold.[citation needed]<br>

Smith is also famous for her role as joint majority shareholder at Norwich City F.C. <br>
Her partner in the shareholding is her husband, Michael Wynn-Jones.<br>
 Her role at the club has attracted varying media attention, from positive when she "saved" the club from bankruptcy, to negative, when making a controversial on-pitch announcement in 2005.<br>


Already an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), Smith was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours, "in recognition of ... [her] contribution to television cookery and recipe writing".</p></div>
