      <div class="r4"><p>preparations<br>
Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.<br>
Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until whites are foamy;<br>
 beat in white sugar and continue beating until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks.<br>
 Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl and quickly fold the almond mixture into the egg whites, about 30 strokes.<br>
Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter,<br>
 about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto prepared baking sheet. <br>
If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold the batter a few more times and retest.<br>
When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. <br>
Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. <br>
Let the piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.<br>
Preheat oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C).<br>
Bake cookies until set but not browned, about 10 minutes; let cookies cool completely before filling.</p></div>
       <div class="r5"><p>ingridents<br>
3 egg whites <br>
1/4 cup white sugar<br>
 1 2/3 cups confectioners' sugar<br>
 1 cup finely ground almonds</p></div>
</div>

      <div class="r3"> <img src ='TIRAMISINI.jpg' height="250px" width="300px"></div>
      <div class="r4"><p>METHOD<br>
You will need 4 x small (approx. 125ml / ½ cup) martini glasses.<br>

Make your espresso and pour it into a heatproof jug, adding the coffee liqueur, then leave it to cool. I find 10 minutes outside the window on a cool day does it!
Break each Savoiardi sponge finger into about 4 and drop the pieces into the martini glasses, then pour the cooled espresso mixture over them. Tamp down gently, making sure the biscuits are soaked all over.
Using an electric hand-held whisk for ease, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks, and set aside for a moment.
Scrape the mascarpone into another bowl, adding the honey; I love the way its mellow sweetness marries with the Marsala, though sugar would be fine too. Beat with the whisk (no need to clean it out first) and, when smooth, slowly beat in the Marsala.
Fold in the egg whites, a third at a time, then dollop this mixture over the soused Savoiardi in each glass, using a spoon to whirl it into a swirly peak at the top.
Let these stand in the fridge for at least 20 minutes and up to 24 hours, then dust with cocoa, pushing it through a fine-mesh strainer, just before serving.</p></div>
       <div class="r5"><p> Ingredients<br>
100 millilitres espresso coffee (or strong instant coffee)<br>
2 tablespoons coffee liqueur<br>
4 savoiardi biscuits (fine sponge fingers)<br>
2 large egg whites<br>
250 grams mascarpone cheese<br>
2 tablespoons honey<br>
2 tablespoons marsala<br>
approx. 1 teaspoon good-quality cocoa powder</p></div>

      <div class="r3"><img src ='cake.jpg' height="250px" width="300px"> </div>
      <div class="r4"><p>METHOD<br>
Blitz the biscuits in a food processor until beginning to turn to crumbs, then add the butter and whiz again to make the mixture clump.
Press this mixture into a 20cm / 8 inch springform tin; press a little up the sides to form a slight ridge.
Beat together the cream cheese, icing sugar, vanilla extract and lemon juice in a bowl until smooth.
Lightly whip the double cream, and then fold it into the cream cheese mixture.
Spoon the cheesecake filling on top of the biscuit base and smooth with a spatula. Put it in the fridge for 3 hours or overnight.
When you are ready to serve the cheesecake, unmould it and spread the black cherry over the top.</p></div>
       <div class="r5"><p> Ingredients<br>

300 grams cream cheese<br>
60 grams icing sugar<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>

       <div class="r3"><img src ='chocolate.jpg' height="250px" width="300px"> </div>
       <div class="r4"><p>DIRECTIONS<br>

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a 1 1/2-quart tall-sided baking dish. Coat with sugar, tapping out excess. Set dish on a rimmed baking sheet.
In a large heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, combine chocolate, vanilla, and 1/4 cup water. Stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, 20 minutes.
Stir egg yolks into cooled chocolate mixture until well combined. Set souffle base aside.
In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-high until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 5 minutes (do not overbeat).
In two additions, fold egg-white mixture into souffle base: With a rubber spatula, gently cut down through center and lift up some base from bottom of bowl. Turning bowl, steadily continue to cut down and lift up base until just combined.
Transfer mixture to dish, taking care not to get batter on top edge of dish; smooth top. Bake souffle until puffed and set, 30 to 35 minutes.</p></div>
